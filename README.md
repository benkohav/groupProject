-- Brief Application description -- 
Project Overview: Our project, an online tech library, provides a forum for students to borrow essential school materials and equipment for a day’s use. Imagine the following scenario: Anna is a commuter student, and upon arriving on campus one day, she realizes that she left her computer charger at home. Our tech library allows Anna to connect with a resource center on campus to borrow a charger for the day.

Project Functionality: Once logged in, the user is redirected to our website’s home page, where a list of popular products (i.e. charger, computer mouse, apple products) is available for browsing. A search bar in our nav bar proves for more targeted browsing, should the user want to search for a specific product. When the user has identified a product they would like to borrow, they can select the item, adding it to their cart, which redirects them to the separate cart page. The cart page allows the user to check out the product, and provides a location in which the item can be picked up. If the user loses an item, a list of suggested replacement options are available on our website for the user to select from. Finally, the profile page allows for the user to change their contact information (i.e. first/last name, email, school year).
